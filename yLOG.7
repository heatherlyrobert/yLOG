.SH IMAGERY
martus (mar-toos, ףטרתש) means witness, record, spectate, or testify

.SH SUMMARY
yLOG is a simple, direct, consistent, and clean shared library for process
execution logging to encourage program monitoring, execution flow understanding,
defensive coding, and early issue detection.

.SH SCOPE, REASONING and DECISION

.B definition (D).  
process execution logging is a method for process self-journalling in order
to gain insight into status, internal settings, execution paths, function
sequencing, and duration/timing.

.B WTF (?).  
building a custom method for such a infrequently reviewed capability seems
retarded at best ;) but, when it is needed, it is a absolutely invaluable
resource.  get good at it.

.B value (V).   
process logging is a rapid way to diagnose process issues.  it is a huge
time saver in build/testing, recreating prodution issues, and regaining
logic/flow knowledge.  saves a lot of debugger time.

.B complication (C).  
tragically, the art of logging and messaging seems to have died with the
"operator" role and is now absent or an incoherent stream of one-dimensional
ad-hoc messages.

.B answer (A).   
i will standardize on a common logging library which can create a clearly
timemarked, indented, and accurate record of program actions which can be
easily searched and filtered.

.B target user (T).  
very technical, well-versed, busy programmers

.B top requirements...
   -- single, sharded library for all logging functions
   -- easy in incorporate into programs
   -- create a structured, searchable 7bit-safe ascii log file
   -- encourage programmers to build logging into programs early
   -- cut significant time from tracing and debugging

.B focus on...
   -- logging program start and conclusion
   -- entry and exit to all major functions
   -- indenting messages to make flow clear
   -- categorizing messages to allow quick filtering and searching
   -- showing critical informational and context messages
   -- provide a standard for warning and errors
   -- giving a true sense of durations and elapsed time
   -- and, foremost, being standard so reading becomes easy and fast
