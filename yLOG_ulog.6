.SH SUMMARY (see yLOG (7) for more information)
yLOG and yLOG_uver allow standardized, structured, and configurable process
execution logging that helps me quickly understand program flow, isolate and
diagnose issues, and therefore much more quickly fix the trouble.

.SH SERIOUS FOREWARNING
i am a crazy, selfish, dog-fooding c-programmer.  my code tends to be
experimental and constantly evolving.  my point is NOT to be the best, it is
to challenge myself, build from scratch, and allow fast problem solving.

.SH A) OVERVIEW
yLOG creates temporary tracing/debugging execution log files, in a specified
area, which can then be reviewed in detail.  the ulog program make access
easier.

.SH B) USAGE
ulog is very simple glue script that can sse the log files and open them in vim.
that's it.  and only has a couple options.  it may be called from anywhere.

.SS ulog l
lists all current .ulog files in the logging area, with line numbers

.SS ulog 4
opens the .ulog listing next to that number

.SS ulog [
opens the head/oldest .ulog file in vim

.SS ulog [ 2
opens the second from oldest in vim

.SS ulog ]
opens the tail/newest .uolg file in vim

.SS ulog ] 3
opens the third from newest .uolg file in vim

.SS ulog x
erases all current .ulog files in the logging area

.SH BUGS
yLOG is incredibly stable for me, but if anyone else used it it might explode
and take the universe with it.

.SH COLOPHON
this page is part of a documentation package meant to make the use of the
heatherly tools easier and faster
